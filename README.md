You can use the **?addbot** command in the [bot's chat](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/okey_bot/chat)  
_or you can contact [8supa](https://www.twitch.tv/8supa) through a whisper_

## Issues/Suggestions

You can create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/0Supa/okeybot/issues)  
or you can use the **?suggest** command followed by the suggestion in the [bot's chat](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/okey_bot/chat)

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/0Supa/okeybot.git`
- `cd okeybot`
- `npm install`
- make a copy of `config_template.json` named `config.json` and add your credentials into it
- **the bot requires a database, you'll either need to create a MariaDB Database and import the tables from the [schema](schema.sql), or adjust the code yourself**
